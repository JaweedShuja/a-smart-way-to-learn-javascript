there are three things
Math.round
Math.ceil
Math.floor

Math.round => round the number to nearest integer if fraction part is 0.5 or greeter then 0.5
	      then it will round to next number like this (1.5 to 2) (1.6 to 2)
	      if fraction is less then 0.5 then number like this (1.4 to 1) (1.1 to 1)	
Math.ceil => forcefully round up like (1.5 to 2) (1.000001 to 2)
Math.floor => forcefully round down like (1.5 to 1) (1.99999 to 1)
